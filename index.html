          <h1>We brew....</h1>
        <p1>We all can agree, our afternoon tea is kind of a big deal. At Cha Bar, we've made it more special for you! Experience the authentic
        flavours from tea houses across China, India and turkey in the heart of the city. Our motive is to bring a villagey, rustic atmosphere 
        that lets you enjoy your delicious cuppa just the way its meant to be.</p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p2> Once you select your flavours from our extensive collection, we’ll carefully time and prepare the brew so as to ensure 
         that you enjoy a delicate tea that evokes the slow brewing skills of the village elders. </p2>
         <br>
         <br>
         <p3> Tea was first discovered in China and India is well known for its unique use of spices and flavours. Turkish tea is an offer you cannot refuse.
           Together, we call these countries as the golden tea triangle.

                                NEW RELEASE
                              
          Want to discover the flavours of Kashmir? 

Our new Kahwa chai is an exotic mix of green tea leaves from the Himalayas, whole spices, nuts and saffron, which was traditionally prepared in a brass kettle known as samovar. The samovar has a central cavity where hot coal is placed while the surrounding space is reserved for boiling the water and other ingredients for the tea. Come experience the glorious brewing as we freshly prepare it for you.

       Since january 2020, we have become a 100% eco-friendly cafe. 
       <br>
       <br>
      Our tea brand is not only organic and fairly traded, but there’s also no tea bag to worry about. 
      <br>
      Our loose-leaf tea is enclosed in backyard compostable packaging that’s made from a cellulose material. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Even our labels on the front and back of the package are compostable and made from hemp-based or sugar cane-based paper. The sugar cane fibers are collected from sugarcane waste, which further helps divert waste from landfills.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      When you’re done drinking your tea, you can easily compost the tea leaves and packaging with no waste. </p8>
