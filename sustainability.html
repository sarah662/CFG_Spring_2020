    Cha Bar is an ethical and environmentally conscious teashop, serving up wholesome hot food, 
    mouth-watering desserts and warm spicy teas, made lovingly by our in-house chef and baristas. 
    At Cha Bar we care about where our ingredients are coming from and choose suppliers that 
    adhere to the same values as us. We are proud to say that all our teas are Rainforest Alliance Certified 
    and that we support farmers, business and villagers in India, Turkey and China with our 
    adherence to the fairtrade standards.

   The Rainforest Alliance is a non-profit organisation, working to create a future in which people and
   nature thrive in harmony.By working together with diverse stakeholders such as farmers, the Rainforest
    Alliance is building an alliance to improve livelihoods, protect biodiversity, amplify the voices of
    farmers and forest communities, and help them mitigate and adapt to climate change.

    We want to make delicious and wholesome food as sustainable and affordable as possible as 
    well as being inclusive of different dietary needs. Because of this, our food menu has multiple
    plant-based options and our meat is 100% grass-fed and organic. We use local and seasonal fruit/veg
    where possible generally supplied by  trusted English farms. We stock organic dairy milks as 
    well as Oatly and Rude Health Almond milk as sustainable alternatives to enjoy with your cup
    of delicious Masala Chai. 
        <br>
        <br>
    We aim to be free of all food waste, so if there is any food leftover at the end of the day,
    we ensure customers/staff don't go home empty handed! We are very concerned about our environment,
    and do our very best to reduce plastic use to a minimum and we only stock compostable 'to go'
    items such as cups and food boxes, but we would still absolutely love it if our customers
    could bring in their own cups and tupperware to cut down on unnecessary waste!
